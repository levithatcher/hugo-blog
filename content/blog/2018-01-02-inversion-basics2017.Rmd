## Background on SLC Air

For those unfamiliar, SLC is famous for its winter temperature inversions. These things are famous for trapping emissions and making life unpleasant. There's tons of great background [here](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~whiteman/PM2.5/PM2.5.html) and [here](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104349/). The focus of _today's_ post will be digging into 2017 values of *PM2.5* in SLC, as this type of pollutant is most frequently linked to [negative health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740125/).

## Get the data

The data we'll be using for the analysis comes from the [UDAQ](https://deq.utah.gov/Divisions/daq/index.htm) via the EPA, which keeps detailed air quality data for various sites in SL County. This post will grab data from Hawthorne Elementary in SLC proper, as that site is noted as being the [most accurate](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~whiteman/PM2.5/PM2.5.html#current_conc) in the valley (and is [actually the site used](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~whiteman/PM2.5/PM2.5.html#current_conc) to determine whether the valley meets EPA standards).

We'll pull 2017 hourly data from [here](https://aqs.epa.gov/api) (you'll have to register) with these parameters:
