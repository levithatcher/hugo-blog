```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      echo = TRUE, dev = 'png',
                      dpi = 200, out.width='650px', fig.width=8, fig.height=4)
```

Let's look at 2013-2017 **daily** data to compare Rose Park (49-035-3010) and Hawthorne Elementary (49-035-3006), both of which are in SLC proper and X miles apart as the crow flies.


```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df3 <- read_csv('../data/SLCFiveSitesDaily2013.csv')
df4 <- read_csv('../data/SLCFiveSitesDaily2014.csv')
df5 <- read_csv('../data/SLCFiveSitesDaily2015.csv')
df6 <- read_csv('../data/SLCFiveSitesDaily2016.csv')
df7 <- read_csv('../data/SLCFiveSitesDaily2017.csv')

df <- dplyr::bind_rows(df3,df4,df5,df6,df7)

# Strip out sites that aren't Rose Park/Hawthorne
df <- df %>%
  filter(AQS_SITE_ID == 490353010 | AQS_SITE_ID == 490353006)
```

For brevity, we've loaded in our data and now will trim out the sites that aren't Hawthorne / Rose Park, and only grab only the columns necessary.

```{r}
dfinal <- df %>% 
  # Hawthorne has several options; grab the most complete record
  filter(POC == 1) %>%
  filter(AQS_PARAMETER_DESC == 'PM2.5 - Local Conditions') %>%
  # Change the Site column to be more readable
  mutate(Site = ifelse(AQS_SITE_ID == 490353006, 'Hawthorne', 'Rose Park')) %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  rename(Measurement = `Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`) %>%
  select(Date, Site, Measurement) %>%
  arrange(Date)

# Look at the data
print(dfinal, 3)
```

While we'd expect roughly 1826 daily measurements over five years, we have less than that (but still enough to work with).

```{r}
dfinal %>% 
  group_by(Site) %>% 
  summarize(`Measurements Per Site` = length(Measurement))
```

Now that we have a simple two-site table to work with, let's see how well the measurements correspond. First, let's  pivot the table such that both sites are in their own column and [compute](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4862334) a 3-day running average.


```{r}
df_pivot <- dfinal %>% 
  tidyr::spread(Site, Measurement)

# Compute 3-day moving average
ma <- function(x, n = 3) {
  stats::filter(x, rep(1/n, n), sides = 2)
}

df_pivot$`Hawthorne MA` <- ma(df_pivot$Hawthorne)

df_pivot$`Rose Park MA` <- ma(df_pivot$`Rose Park`)
```

Now we plot the 3-day running average for both Hawthorne and Rose Park.

```{r}
library(scales)
ggplot(df_pivot, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Hawthorne MA`, colour = "Hawthorne")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Rose Park MA`, colour = "Rose Park")) +
  labs(title = "3-Day Running Average PM2.5 in SLC from 2013 - 2017") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_y_log10(name = "PM2.5 µg/m3", 
                limits = c(1,NA), 
                breaks = c(1, 5, 10, 15)) +
  scale_x_date(name = "Year", 
               labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), 
               breaks = date_breaks("1 year"))

```

While the missing data is annoying, it indeed _looks_ like there is fairly good agreement between the Hawthorne and Rose Park daily PM2.5 values from 2013-2017. And it indeed appears that for both sites winter air quality has improved since 2013 (more to come below).

Even though Hawthorne and Rose Park both move together, how to they differ? To check longer-term differences, let's plot with a `loess` smoother (which is built into `ggplot2`).

```{r}
library(scales)
ggplot(df_pivot, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Hawthorne, colour = "Hawthorne"), method = 'loess') +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = `Rose Park`, colour = "Rose Park"), method = 'loess') +
  labs(title = "Smoothed PM2.5 in SLC from 2013 - 2017") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_y_log10(name = "PM2.5 µg/m3", 
                limits = c(1,NA), 
                breaks = c(1, 5, 7, 10, 15)) +
  scale_x_date(name = "Year", 
               labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d"), 
               breaks = date_breaks("1 year"))

```

Interesting--Rose Park PM2.5 levels are systematically higher than those at Hawthorne Elementary (which is in the Liberty Wells neighborhood). While a background difference between of ~1ug/m3 doesn't seem like much, this smoothing likely hides shorter-term spikes; even differences in low-level PM2.5 exposure [can lead to adverse health effects](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747). 

While this isn't confirmed, the heightened PM2.5 levels in Rose Park could come from the local refinery, which is just 1.5 miles from the measurement site.

Now, let's make the year-over-year comparison crystal clear.
