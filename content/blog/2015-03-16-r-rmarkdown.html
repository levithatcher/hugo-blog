<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I’ve started this blog to help organize my thoughts relative to data science, machine learning, statistics, logic-based analysis, and various visualization tools. The focus will be on data-related tools and techniques. While I’ll keep these posts applicable to a wide (data-interested) audience, I’m sure the analysis will occasionally focus on Salt Lake City, where I’m currently based.</p>
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to show how easy it is to create choropleths with R and choroplethr, showing diabetes rates for each county in the US. For those who love maps and data, choropleths are the holy grail of nerd-dom. If you’re unclear on this, choropleths allow you to take a simple map and essentially lay data on top. Great, right?!</p>

<h3>Getting public health data</h3>
<p>First, let’s pull 2015 county-level data from <a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/rankings/data">County Health Rankings</a>, which is a fantastic place to analyze state by geographic health differences in the US.</p>
<p>We pull the data into R…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read.csv(&#39;../data/2015 CHR Analytic Data.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="clean-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Clean up</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove state-summary rows
df &lt;- df[df$COUNTYCODE != 0,]

# Grab only the columns we&#39;re interested in--CountyID and Diabetes rate
df &lt;- df[,c(&quot;COUNTYCODE&quot;, &quot;STATECODE&quot;, &quot;Diabetes.Value&quot;)]

# Encode for choroplethr
df$COUNTYCODE &lt;- as.integer(df$COUNTYCODE)
  
# Pad county digits
df$COUNTYCODE &lt;- sprintf(&quot;%03d&quot;, df$COUNTYCODE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="create-proper-county-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Create Proper county code</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># Concatenate and create FIPS
df$FIPSCODE &lt;- as.numeric(paste0(df$STATECODE,df$COUNTYCODE))

# Reduce dataset and rename cols for county_choropleth func
df_final &lt;- df[,c(&#39;FIPSCODE&#39;, &quot;Diabetes.Value&quot;)]
colnames(df_final) &lt;- c(&quot;region&quot;,&quot;value&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="plot-the-choropleth" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot the choropleth</h3>
<p>We’ll use a function to make it easily repeatable.</p>

<div id="the-result" class="section level2">
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Voilà, a choropleth! Since this isn’t a post on diabetes, we can simply say that the deep south has serious issues with chronic disease.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about this R package is that you can fairly quickly plot any of the awesome county-level data* you can find <a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/rankings/data">here</a>, <a href="https://www.data.gov">here</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of maps, if you’re in the market for a US map for the house, you probably can’t do better than <a href="http://www.imusgeographics.com/usa-maps">this</a>–it was made by one man in a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/01/the_best_american_wall_map_david_imus_the_essential_geography_of_the_united_states_of_america_.html">farm house in Oregon</a>.</p>
<p>* Note you’ll have to make sure the data has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code">FIPS Code</a></p>
