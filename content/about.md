Levi did his graduate work at the University of Utah, studying atmospheric predictability in the context of hurricane development.
 
At Health Catalyst, Levi led the companyâ€™s machine learning efforts, built the team of five data scientists, and founded [healthcare.ai](http://healthcare.ai), the first open-source machine learning software for healthcare.

As of August 2018, Levi is excited for his move to Pluralsight in SLC, where he'll be focusing on product experiments and ML.
